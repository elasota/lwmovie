RoQ is a video format with low decoding complexity at the expense of quality.  It is significantly lower quality than MPEG video, but requires much less CPU to decode, making it a bit more suitable for uses where CPU costs are a major constraint.

It has a few important caveats:
- Due to the design of the codec, it is substantially better at preserving detail at low resolutions.
- It has a higher minimum memory cost than MPEG video (16x16 resolution granularity, 48 bits per pixel).

The RoQ encoder is based on a combination of Switchblade 3 and the FFmpeg RoQ encoder.
The RoQ decoder is based on Switchblade 2.

Both are based on a paper from 2001 by Dr. Tim Ferguson describing the RoQ file format.
