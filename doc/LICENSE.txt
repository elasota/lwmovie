lwmovie employs several third party libraries.  Files that contain third-party
code should indicate which licenses they fall under at the start of the file.

Here is a rough summary of which licenses which third-party components and
what license they fall under, in addition to the lwmovie license described
below.

- Complete lwmovie library (lwmovie+lwcelt+mp2dec2+lwroq):
    mpegplay (BSD), libopus (Xiph), Ogg Vorbis (Xiph)
- lwmovie (without linked dependencies): mpegplay (BSD)
- mp2dec2: Ogg Vorbis (Xiph)
- lwcelt: libopus (Xiph)
- lwroqenc: FFmpeg (LGPL 2.1)

Note that the LGPL license for the lwroqenc component applies only to the
lwroq encoding tool and its associated source code and does not apply to the
lwmovie RoQ decoder implementation.
