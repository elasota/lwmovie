lwmovie supports GPU decoding using Direct3D 11 at the 10.0 feature level
or higher.

There are two modes that you can use it in:
- You can create a D3D11 frame provider, which performs reconstruction on the
  CPU, but outputs directly to D3D11 textures.
- You can create a D3D11 reconstructor as well, which uses a mix of pixel and
  compute shaders to perform the bulk of the computational work.

The second option is much faster, but also consumes about 6.125 additional
bytes of memory per pixel of video resolution.

In both modes, the frame provider will output to textures accessible using
SRVs provided by the frame provider instead of to memory.  Most importantly,
you should never attempt to lock frames from the D3D11 frame provider.  Doing
so will frequently fail if using software reconstruction and will always fail
when using D3D11 reconstruction.

The D3D11 frame provider is intended to be accessed via shader resource views
rather than directly.  You can get the SRV of a work frame using the
lwmD3D11FrameProvider_GetWorkFramePlaneSRV call.

If you use the D3D11 reconstructor, lwmMovieState_FeedData and lwmCake_Decode
may clear the device context state and may do so even if they don't produce
a renderable video frame.

The work frames may be a different size from the video output, in which case
you will need to clip them when rendering.  You can determine the size of the
work frame textures using the getWorkFramePlaneWidthFunc and
getWorkFramePlaneHeightFunc functions in the frame provider API, and the draw
area using lwmMovieState_GetStreamParameterU32 with the
lwmSTREAMPARAM_U32_Width and lwmSTREAMPARAM_U32_Height stream parameters.

If you are using Cake, you can inspect the lowerRightTexCoords field
of the decode output instead, which will contain normalized texture
coordinates of the lower-right corner of the drawable area in the work frame
textures.

Also important is that lwmovie supports two YCbCr formats: BT.601 and JPEG.
You can determine which format the video is in using
lwmMovieState_GetStreamParameterU32 with the
lwmSTREAMPARAM_U32_VideoChannelLayout stream parameter, which will return a
value from the lwmEVideoChannelLayout enum.

If you are using Cake, then you can use lwmCake_GetYCbCrWeights instead.
