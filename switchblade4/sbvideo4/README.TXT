
CInputBox version 0.2

C/C++ InputBox implementation that allows to have a simple InputBox
like visual basic's one. It is coded in simple win32 API calls without MFC.

Before using this source code, you have to read and accept LICENSE.TXT

There is no documentation at the moment, see the examples CInputBoxTest.cpp
(for C++ language) or CInputBoxTest.c (for C language) to understand how to
use the class. There are a lot of features undocumented and some that still
miss. Project files for VisualC 6.0 and Dev-C++ 4.9+ are attached.

I would be happy to see your feedback on the project forums.
